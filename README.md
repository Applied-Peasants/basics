## Overview

Welcome to the Learning Portal provided by the DataRookies community!  

This is one of 3 hubs where you can interact with the community:
1. **The Learning Portal (YOU ARE HERE!):** You can find links to tutorials and classes to help build your data skills!

2. **The Facebook Group:** You can get information on events - such as meetups - and community announcements (This is open to everyone!)

3. **The Slack Community:** You can interact with the community, talk about anything under the Data sun, and get the latest updates!

You don't really need to visit or join everything, feel free to just join which works for you!

This is an evolving resource so check back time-to-time to see the latest and greatest!

This is also an open community project, so feel free to push your own commits to this repo with updated links or better tutorials to help those who are just starting out!
