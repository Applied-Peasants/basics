You don't really need to visit or join everything, feel free to just join which works for you!

## The Learning Portal

This Learning Portal is an effort of the DataRookies community to help those who are starting to learn Data Science find the right resources for the right level. The portal is meant to be a collation of articles, tutorials, and other learning materials that could serve as a guide for one's learning journey.

This is an open community project, so feel free to push your own commits to this repo with updated links or better tutorials to help those who are just starting out!

Please refer to this guide (insert link) on how to contribute to this repo.

## Disclaimer

This project is definitely a work in progress and we would love to see your contributions in this. Our limited experience will limit the resources shown here, but with your help we can make this the hub for anyone who wants to learn Data Science related skills and tools!
